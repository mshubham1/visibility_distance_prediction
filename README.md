## Overview  📜
The application is a web app which is developed in Flask Framework.
## Dataset  
Dataset available in IBM : https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/jfk-weather-data/

The NOAA JFK dataset contains 114,546 hourly observations of various local climatological variables (including visibility, temperature, wind speed and direction, humidity, dew point, and pressure). The data was collected by a NOAA weather station located at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York.
