## Overview  📜
The application is a web app which is developed in Flask Framework.

## Dataset  
Dataset available in IBM : https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/jfk-weather-data/

The NOAA JFK dataset contains 114,546 hourly observations of various local climatological variables (including visibility, temperature, wind speed and direction, humidity, dew point, and pressure). The data was collected by a NOAA weather station located at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in Queens, New York.
## Installations  🗄️
The Code is written in Python 3.8 If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository:
